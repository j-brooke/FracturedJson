        <p>FracturedJson is a family of utilities that format
            <a href="(https://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JSON data</a> in a way that's easy for
            humans to read, but fairly compact.  Arrays and objects are written on single lines, as long as they're
            neither too long nor too complex.  When several such lines are similar in structure, they're written with
            fields aligned like a table.  Long arrays are written with multiple items per line across multiple lines.</p>

        <p>There are lots of settings available to control the output, but for the most part you can ignore them.
            FracturedJson produces nice-looking output from any set of JSON data automatically.</p>
